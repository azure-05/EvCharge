	<h1>Services</h1>

	<p class="Home-Services"> The world is going electric and so are we. EvCharge provides self charging stations to assist customers in charging their vehicular batteries in the queue.<br>
	They aid in the effective charging of all electric cars within the customers to charge their electric vehicles.<br>
	<br>
	These stations can be viewed through our map, which locates the nearest one. EvCharging stations can also be purchased for personal use at home, in an office, or in other 
	personal lots; <strong>not to be used for commercial use.</strong></p>
	
	<h1>Benefits</h1>
