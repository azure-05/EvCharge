				<h1 class="about"> Boosting the EV experience </h1>
	
				<p class="about"> Since electric automobiles are becoming increasingly powerful and popular due to 
				the lessened impact on the environment, becoming a recognizable brand that offers more technology solutions for electric vehicles 
				while influencing positive change in the environment is our main mission. By joining forces with car
				manufactures as these are providing more electric vehicles, delivering more alternatives for the car industry
				is a great asset in making the world a better place.</p>

		<h1 class="Company-Overview"> Company Overview </h1>
		
		<p> The company EvCharge creates self-charging stations for electric vehicles to help with the effectiveness of charging in one's home and while driving, 
		giving them more options for customers to manage their electric cars. It will be a device that simultaneously charges multiple car batteries in facilities, at homes, 
		and in public places rather than a gas pump model. The company offers customers a choice between purchasing a charging station device, using one that 
		is available in some public locations across the US, or going to areas where staff help customers charge their batteries.</p>
	
		<h1> No more battery anxiety </h1>

			</div>
		
			<p> As more cars manufactures are working towards promoting long-lasting battery life, the current methods of charging such as those found in gas pump models are not as fast 
			as the traditional gas models. <br>
			<br>
			EvCharge brings the solution of charging the batteries through the swappable method in kiosks models found on the road, in our local office, and those for personal use,
			enabling the "grab and go" action rather than waiting for electric vehicles to charge for 30 or more minutes.</p>
